# Website Project - COM 421
### by Josh Bowden

## Walkthrough
https://jbowden.me/com421/

In this project, I constructed a professional website for myself. The website had three sections—the front page with a brief about me, a page dedicated to my professional resume, and another extra page for different places that I have visited across the world.
The homepage with the about me page is brief and is designed to get the internet visitor interested in my perspective and the work that I am current doing. There is also an easily accessible link to the PDF of my resume making it easy for potential recruiters. The resume page goes in more depth about previous jobs that I have worked at and different skills and talents to show case. Last, the travel page has a short list of places that I have lived in or visited. Picture of specific notable places from the trips are shown beside each location.

## Future Improvements
Given more time on the project, I would want to make the resume more interactive with examples from each of the pieces of work. Additionally, I would want to add a section blogging about topics that interest me in technology and computer science. I’m not exactly a design artist and prefer to keep it minimalistic, but I would like to improve the design somewhat and try different styles.
