      <description>Snipped and backdated from a previous Reddit post of mine.
 As /u/x-paste was suggesting in the [Official] Object Orientation Discussion thread about ad-hoc data structures, I still think you can get the niceness and flexibility of just throwing code togeather while still having strong typing.
That or have gradual typing to avoid the messy example I wrote for the otherwise simple eval() and can just use any like in TypeScript and don&amp;rsquo;t bother with being extremely sound and specific.</description>
